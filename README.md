# WPGraphQL Publishers Workshop Extension

This plugin was created for use in my "Content Syndication with GraphQL" workshop at the 2017 WordCamp for Publishers conference.

This plugin serves as an example of how WPGraphQL can be extended to serve as a proxy for other WPGraphQL enabled sites.

## Installation

First, make sure you have WPGraphQL (v0.0.15+) installed and activated. 

Then clone or download this repo into your WordPress install's `/wp-content/plugins` directory. 

Activate the plugin.
